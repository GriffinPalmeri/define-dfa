A Python 3 class called DFA (in a file named
dfa.py) that represents a DFA. Your class will have a constructor that takes the name
of a file, and initializes the DFA from the file contents. (This is a named parameter.)
The class will also have a method called simulate that simulates the computation of
the DFA on a parameter string s, and reports if s is accepted by M.
